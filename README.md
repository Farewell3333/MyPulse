Practical application of JAVA SWING, the program aimed to showcase basic knowledge of JAVA to my teacher. It also includes a slightly humorous aspect. In class, we wrote a console program with pulse measurements, which was designed to teach the basics. I took it to a slightly higher level by using JAVA SWING. The ??? option utilizes interesting SWING functions that may resemble old viruses.
